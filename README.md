# Housing Price Prediction

This project implements a simple housing price prediction model using the California Housing dataset. It uses a linear regression model to predict housing prices based on various features.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the project:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## Dataset

The dataset used is the California Housing dataset, which is available in `sklearn.datasets`.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python housing_price_prediction.py
   ```

## Key Features
- Loads the California Housing dataset
- Splits the data into training and testing sets
- Trains a linear regression model
- Predicts housing prices
- Calculates the Mean Squared Error (MSE)

## Output

The script prints the model coefficients and the Mean Squared Error for model evaluation.
